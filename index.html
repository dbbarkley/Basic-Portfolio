                              <p  class='clear-none'>Hey There! I’m Daniel Barkley.  I am a husband, father, musician, & astronomy nerd. 
                                  When I’m not working installing security systems you can find me playing with my son at our home in Austin, TX, 
                                  watching cooking shows with my wife, or heading out to find the best Tex-Mex in town. </p>
                                  <p class='clear-none'>I love listening to great music, learning new things, watching good movies, and eating delicious food. 
                                      But more than anything, I love spending time with my family. No matter how late I’m working or how far I’m traveling, 
                                      my heart always stays at home with the people I love. They are my biggest inspiration to work</p>
                              <p class='clear-both'>hard, learn more and go 
                                    after the opportunities in front of me.No matter where life takes me I’m thankful to have my family by side, friends who support me, 
                                  and a city with the best tacos money can buy. </p>
